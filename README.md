# Raytracer-Tutorial-Shapes
This is an assignment we did in school to learn how to create different object shapes using raytracing and create images from the information given in the code.

## Demo
This example-demo shows different shapes such as:
- OBB
- Plane
- Sphere
- Triangle

All the objects are at different depths, which makes it possible to decide which object is visible "at the front" of the image.
All objects are rendered to a ppm file.
